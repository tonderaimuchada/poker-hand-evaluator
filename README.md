# poker-hand-evaluator
Poker hand evaluator tool - Ramp group assessment

Instructions to run the project:
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory with "PokerHandEvaluator.java" file.
2. Run the command: "javac PokerHandEvaluator.java", to create executable bytecode.
3. A new "PokerHandEvaluator" .class file will be created.
4. Run that class file using the command: "java PokerHandEvaluator".
5. Follow instructions appearing on the terminal to use the evaluator tool. 


Rooms for improvement:
To evaluate multiple hands, individual calls to the evaluator should be made and see the results. If there is a tie, evaluate the hands again and the winner is the one with the highest ranking card among the hand - otherwise it remains a tie.
